# Hello-World
introduction to github

My name is Steven and I am teaching myself to code. I am constantly amazed at all the resources available and all of the knowledge that people are so enthusiastically sharing everyday. I love to learn new things and explore topics in depth. This journey of learning to code is teaching me things about myself including my strengths and weaknesses. I often find myself staring at a blank screen not knowing exactly where to start and I am trying to work on my planning skills to break things down into smaller pieces and conquer them step by step. I want to make myself proud by doing something that I didn't think I was creative or smart enough to do.

In this repository we are learning to create or initialize a repository, create a branch, make changes to that branch and comment what changes were made and why.
